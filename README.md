# BBC News Labs - Gourmet Engineer Application

Please find in this repository my completed tech test the BBC Gourmet Engineer role.

To install and run code, please follow these instructions:

git clone git@github.com:georgiamshaw/newslabs.git

npm install
```

JSON files are in the repo, but to write to them again:

## My approach

- I did my best to take a test driven development approach, and have written tests to check each of my util functions. If I'd had more time, I would have liked to write more tests, and test for potential edge cases.

- I've separated the logic in my code from the main script.js file by creating a util folder and separate files for each part of the task. If I'd had a bit longer, I would have abstracted out more of the logic, as there's lots of repetition in the different util files.
